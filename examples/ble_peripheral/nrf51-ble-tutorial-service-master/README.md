# nrf5-ble-tutorial-service
This example is meant to be used togheter with the tutorial "BLE Services, a beginner's tutorial" found on https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/8/. The purpose of the tutorial is to get you started with the basics of BLE, the nRF5x DK, and the SDK. More specifically we will go through the bare minimum of steps to get your first service up and running. The tutorial is meant to be a fun way to get you started with something functional, and maybe inspire you to go further with BLE. It is also intended to be a natural continuation of the tutorial "BLE Advertising, a beginner's tutorial". Here you will not learn details of the BLE protocol, but we will have a quick look at what you should know before building a service.
