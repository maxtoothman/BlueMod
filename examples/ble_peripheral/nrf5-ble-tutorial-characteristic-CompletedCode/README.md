#Proposed Solution for nrf5-ble-tutorial-characteristic.
This branch shows how the code might look after completing the tutorial. It also has some additional code to print out a few status messages to a UART terminal so you can learn more about the handles etc.

#About this project
This application is one of several applications that has been built by the support team at Nordic Semiconductor, as a demo of some particular feature or use case. It has not necessarily been thoroughly tested, so there might be unknown issues. It is hence provided as-is, without any warranty. However, in the hope that it still may be useful also for others than the ones we initially wrote it for, we've chosen to distribute it here on GitHub. The application is built to be used with the official nRF5 SDK, that can be downloaded from http://developer.nordicsemi.com/.
